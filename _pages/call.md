We invite submissions of papers on all topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning for children and pediatrics. All papers will be reviewed in a double-blind process and accepted papers will be presented at the workshop.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

1. *New Methods for AI in Pediatrics (Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, LLMs, Reinforcement learning, Supervised, Semi- and Self-supervised Learning, Time series analysis, etc.)*

2. *New Datasets and Benchmarks about Children (Pediatrics, Child Psychology, Child Development, Education, etc.)*

3. *New Viewpoint about Risk for Child Development in the AI Ara*


Submissions should be between 4--8 pages in length for the main text, formatted according to the NeurIPS style file. There is no limit on the length of the references and appendix. All accepted papers will be non-archival, and each submission will undergo a rigorous review by at least 2-3 reviewers in the AI field and 1 reviewer from the pediatrics field in a double-blind manner. Conflicts of interest will be managed using the OpenReview platform's mechanisms.
