### Measures & Metrics (Regulatory)
ITU Document: FGAI4H-K-045
* Started 2020
* Scope: Collection of SOTA ML quality assurance methods (bias, robustness and uncertainty, explainability, generalization, …)
* Megalomania: move to easy to maintain and use web resource (see “aiaudit.org”).
* Schedule
  - Friday, 2:00 PM

### Reporting Package
* Started on 02/2020.
* Scope: Provide a unified structure to communicate and report the assessment results and their limitations
* Megalomania: see our joint OCI goals, a standard for ML4H reporting
* Schedule: Tuesday, 4:00 PM
  - Asynchronous (discord and slack)
* Contact

### Perturbed minds (Software Development)
* Started 10/2020
* Scope:  Plausible robustness testing in medical imaging (see FGAI4H-K-050)
* Megalomania: Share our code base, scientific publications
* Schedule: Friday, 1:00 PM
* Contact
  - Luis Oala: luis.oala@hhi.fraunhofer.de

### Transparent model reporting (Research)
* Started 1/2021
* Scope:  A study on the practice of transparent model reporting (see Jana’s presentation yesterday)
* Megalomania: scientific publication
* Schedule: Thursday, 4:00 PM
* Contact
  - Jana Fehr: jana.fehr@hpi.de

### "aiaudit.org" (Website Development)
* Started 1/2021
* Alignment with Xavier colleagues and others in our network
* Scope: Crowdsourced web collection of SOTA AI quality assurance methods, showcase our work
* Motivation: SOTA moves fast -> doc based SOTA collection unwieldy -> move towards crowd curated, web-based list
