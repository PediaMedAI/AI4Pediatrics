Modern AI systems based on deep learning, reinforcement learning or hybrids thereof constitute a flexible, complex and often opaque technology. Limits in our understanding of an AI systemâ€™s behavior constitute risks for system failure. Hence, the identification of failure modes in AI systems is an important pre-requisite for their reliable deployment to real-world settings.

*aiaudit.org* is a [cooperative of humans](https://aiaudit.org/contributors/) working at the intersection of machine learning research, regulation, software development and application domains. We [design methods, processes and standardization](https://aiaudit.org/outputs/) contributing towards AI technology that can be trusted for use in real-world applications. For that purpose, many of us contribute their expertise to standardization efforts such as the [ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx) or [Xavier AI Team](https://www.xavierhealth.org/news3/2020/11/11) of the FDA's Digital Health Center of Excellence.

This site is the group's interface to present and organize its work. We maintain information on current projects and their coordinates [on the project sites](https://aiaudit.org/workstreams/). We invite you to take a look. If you are interested to contribute or learn more about our modus operandi please [consult the join page](https://aiaudit.org/join/). We are committed to equitable collaboration. Project groups form in a self-organized way and are open to interested persons from research, companies, the general public or otherwise.
