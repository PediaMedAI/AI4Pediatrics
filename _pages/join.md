A
Artificial Intelligence Audit or AI Audit is a workgroup from the Focus Group Artificial Intelligence for Health (FGAI4H), a  joint project between the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), World Health Organization (WHO), Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institute. Originally called Data Artificial Intelligence and Assessment Methods (DAISAM), we want to develop solutions and standards to provide better regulation and interaction between the people, the institutions, and the companies.

Our mission is to provide the most secure interaction between the people, the institutions, and the health companies, presenting them solutions based on Machine Learning, theories, and the recent state-of-art about the interaction between AI and Health about robustness, bias, and other aspects of applied methods. Inside of all, there are essential values like humanity, improvement, compromise, friendship, and the most fluid desire to reach all people's lives by our research.

Our team has members from different countries and continents and different academic and professional status levels like undergraduate students, masters and Ph.D.'s, entry-level to senior specialists. We share our values and cultures to identify new answers to regulate Machine Learning for Health standards.  Because of this, we develop different workstreams(**here**). Each one has its coordinators. If you contribute and develop new solutions, presenting on the FGAI4H plenary and everything else, you can be a new project or workstream leader. We never want to limit the potential of our group and especially, colleagues.

Our online organization works weekly with meetings for our workstreams. We suggest that you visit each of these meetings to identify what project you feel secure in contributing to our initiative. We don't have a limitation about how many projects you can participate in, but we need your compromise after you declare that you are a member of one workstream. You can add our calendar file (.ics) to add to your calendar as a new option.

About meetings, we use different platforms to connect and provide all members a space to include their ideas & solutions. Usually, we use an AI Audit Zoom room to have our live meetings. You can find all information about each room inside of the calendar and meeting days. Besides this, we have asynchronous meetings using Discord & Trello depending on the coordinator(s) decision.

Otherwise, we use the most current project management methods and frameworks to develop the workstreams. Using Github, we can provide a full comprehension of steps developed working with Kanban and Scrum, the pipeline, teams, tracking tasks and issues, and shared documents that we are developing. Transparency in all activities is vital to reach results and attract more people to the mission. To understand better the structure of each project, you can check the miro flowchart.

If you want to develop new projects with a cool, highly trained, and inspire your life to help people worldwide, feel free to be part of our workgroup!
