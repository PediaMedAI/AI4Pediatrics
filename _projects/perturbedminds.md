# Project Scope

Perturbed Minds is an initiative to discuss more regulations inside Machine Learning and the importance of images, methods, and codes.

## Aims and Objectives
Create a discussion about medical imaging and robustness by scientific publications, seminars & webinars.

## Planned Outputs
Manufacturers, academics, health users notified regulatory bodies.
