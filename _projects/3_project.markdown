**Overview**

Assessment Platform(AP) is an international initiative to create an open source to promote health analysis. This Open Code Project aims to produce the digital building blocks (six software packages) that compose the FG-AI4H Assessment Platform. The assessment platform, which can be distinguished from AI “challenge” platforms through its consideration of regulatory guidelines and the needs of other AI for health stakeholders, supports the end-to-end assessment of AI for health algorithms under the coordination of Marc Lecoultre.

AI Audit is contributing with two software packages of the AP: Evaluation and Reporting.

**Evaluation Package**

**Description and Purpose**

Model performance is dependent on the choice of metric and possible parameters. Thus, it is of utmost importance to have a framework that allows for the comparison of the performance of different AI models. EP provides meaningful, state-of-the-art metrics that promise high expressibility.

**Functionalities**
Offers testing measures and methods for different quality dimensions including interpretation, bias, uncertainty, and robustness; questionnaires provide qualitative evaluation

**Target Groups**
Manufacturers, notified regulatory bodies.

**Schedule**
* Tuesday, 4:00 PM
* Asynchronous (Discord Server)

**Reporting Package**
RP delivers a standardized format for communicating and reporting the properties, features, intended use, and limitations of AI for health to help connect different stakeholders.

**Functionalities**
A customizable reporting interface that presents the results of EP.

**Target Groups**
Manufacturers, notified regulatory bodies, users of AI for health (doctors, patients), and vendors of AI for health.

        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
