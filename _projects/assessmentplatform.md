# Project Scope

Assessment Platform(AP) is an international initiative to create an open-source to promote health analysis. This Open Code Project aims to produce the digital building blocks (six software packages) that compose the FG-AI4H Assessment Platform. The assessment platform, which distinguishes it from AI "challenge" platforms through its consideration of regulatory guidelines and the needs of other AI for health stakeholders, supports the end-to-end assessment of AI for health algorithms under Marc Lecoultre's coordination.

AI Audit is contributing with two software packages of the AP: Evaluation and Reporting.

# Evaluation Package

# Project Scope

Model performance is dependent on the choice of metric and possible parameters. Thus, it is of utmost importance to have a framework that allows for comparing the performance of different AI models. EP provides meaningful, state-of-the-art metrics that promise high expressibility.

## Aims and Objectives
Offers testing measures and methods for different quality dimensions, including interpretation, bias, uncertainty, and robustness; questionnaires provide a qualitative evaluation

## Planned Outputs
A software package to manufacturers notified regulatory bodies.

# Reporting Package

# Project Scope
RP delivers a standardized format for communicating and reporting the properties, features, intended use, and limitations of AI for health to help connect different stakeholders.

## Aims and Objectives
A customizable reporting interface that presents the results of EP.

## Planned Outputs
A software package to manufacturers, notified regulatory bodies, AI users for health (doctors, patients), and vendors of AI for health.
