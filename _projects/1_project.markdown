**Project Scope**

This project aims at the development of good machine learning practice guidelines to educate the developers and manufacturers of healthcare AI solutions on how to conduct a comprehensive requirements analysis and conformity assessment procedures for continual product improvement in an iterative and adaptive manner in conformance with the applicable standards and regulations.

**Aims and Obectives**

–	To help manufacturers familiarize with international laws and regulations that applies to AI/ML-based medical devices and to bring them to market quickly and effectively.

–	To help internal and external auditors test the legal conformity of AI/ML-based medical devices and the associated life-cycle process

**Regulatory Scope**

    –	with enforcement of regulations
    –	without enforcement of regulations.

b) Product scope
  –	software is the product ->standalone software –Software-as-medical device (SaMD)
  –	software is embedded in the product- Software-in-medical device (SiMD)
